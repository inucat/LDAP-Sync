# A LDAP Sync adapter for Android

```
NOTICE

This app is currently unmaintained - I don't use it anymore personally, and don't 
have the time to maintain it. If someone wants to step in, feel free to fork it - 
I only forked it myself some years ago, because it was unmainted by the author.

It seems that it is not compatible with the most recent versions of Android.

LDAP-Sync can sync entries from a remote LDAP server to your phone's Contacts, making them available offline. They are then accessible to all apps with permission to read your address book. It works read-only and never changes data on the remote server.
